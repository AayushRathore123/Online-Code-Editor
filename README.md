# Online Code Editor
Online Code Editor is a free and open-source online real-time code editor that allows you to write, execute and test your code using c and python languages.
It'll be perfect for anybody who wants to quickly write and run some code without opening a full-featured IDE on their computer.
Moreover, it can be used by companies during the recruitment of software developers. This will help companies to administer these tests and score the candidates based on the performance of their code when run against some test cases.

### The aim of this full-stack web application is to provide an instant online coding and test platform and to provide practice coding questions.
+ It allow users to create a new account or log in to the existing account to access saved files.
+ They can also solve different types of questions and according to their difficulty level. 

This project is based on MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.
+ MongoDB — document database
+ Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
+	React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
+	Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server
